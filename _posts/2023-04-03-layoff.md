I was laid off from Drizly last week. It's the first time in my 13 year career that I've ever been laid off. Though that's not particularly surprising as most of that career has been with the same firm that exists pretty far afield from the big tech industry.

Since I switched jobs to Drizly, I've never really been "off" the job search, though I'm starting it in earnest now. I'll try to record some of my thoughts and ideas that I've had while filling out applications, reaching out to strangers, and talking about myself non-stop.
