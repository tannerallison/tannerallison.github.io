# About Me

I'm an experienced Senior Software Engineer, most recently working for Drizly. Before that I spent 10 years working for Tyler Technologies doing everything from greenfield tax software in C# to writing a custom ETL program and sql script runner to creating a web portal atop several mature products written in three different languages.
